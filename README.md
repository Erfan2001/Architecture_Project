 # Architecture Project
 
Design CPU

## Project description:

In this particular phase, your primary objective centers around the meticulous design of your processor. The pivotal first step entails the formulation of a comprehensive instruction set tailored to the unique requirements of your processor. It is of paramount importance to strike a judicious balance when deciding the size of your instruction set. An overly diminutive set may pose challenges when programming for this processor, significantly augmenting the complexity of your design endeavors. Therefore, exercise prudence and rationale in determining the size of your instruction set, cognizant of the potential intricacies that may arise during the subsequent design stages.

As you embark on the design journey, it's worth noting that you have access to an array of design tools at your disposal. Logisim, for instance, serves as a robust and versatile tool for the creation and visualization of your processor's architecture. However, should you opt not to employ this tool or any other similar alternatives, you may resort to sketching your design concept on paper. It is essential to emphasize that, in the event of choosing this latter approach, a proportionate reduction factor of 0.25 will be applied to your evaluation. Hence, the judicious utilization of design tools is encouraged to ensure the efficiency and effectiveness of your processor's design process.
